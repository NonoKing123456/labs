Answers to exercises G1--G3:

G1:

It searches through every file in the current folder and its subfolders for any line containing the word smutex and prints the file names and matching lines.

./sthread.cpp:void smutex_init(smutex_t *mutex)
./sthread.cpp:void smutex_destroy(smutex_t *mutex)
./sthread.cpp:void smutex_lock(smutex_t *mutex)
./sthread.cpp:void smutex_unlock(smutex_t *mutex)

G2:
grep "Task" RequestGenerator.cpp

grep "return" *.h

G3:

smutex — match any line containing this word.
.* — match any characters (possibly none) after it.
(.*) — match parentheses with any content inside.
; — the line ends with a semicolon.

This finds lines where smutex is part of a function call or statement ending with a semicolon, like smutex_lock(&res); or smutex_unlock(&mtx[i]);.
It identifies where mutex functions (like lock/unlock) are actually called in your code, helping you see which parts of your program use synchronization operations.
